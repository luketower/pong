# Pong with C and SDL2

Building pong with C and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) on OSX.  Some of the code is translated from [Games with
Go](https://gameswithgo.org/) [(Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RAwgmLjdCs&list=PLDZujg-VgQlZUy1iCqBbe5faZLMkA3g2x&index=8).
Using this as a way to learn C programming and basic game development.

### Setup

* Install SDL2. I used the directions in [this post](https://medium.com/@edkins.sarah/set-up-sdl2-on-your-mac-without-xcode-6b0c33b723f7).

### Build
```bash
make run    # compiles and runs the game
make build  # compiles the game to ./pong executable
make clean  # removes executable and debug symbols
```
